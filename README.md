# Word-Triva-Educational-Game
For HCI class CS 545
<br>
WE ARE USING NODE.JS, MONGODB, JAVASCRIPT, HTML!!!!
<br>
MAKE BRANCHES WHEN YOU WRITE THE CODE SO THAT WE CAN MERGE THEM INTO MAIN LATER!!!!
<br>
<br>
Routes and Implementation
<br>
/home- the main route, shows what website is about, links to other pages, etc
<br>
/signup- users sign up for an account here
<br>
/login- users log into their account here
<br>
/profile- display users info here (can only be shown when user is logged in)
<br>
/flashcards- display cards that the user can learn here 
<br>
/game- a simple game to remember the word
<br>
<br>
<br>
To preload the words for the game. 
<br>
MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD MONGODB BEFORE DOING THIS
<br>
Go to the root directory and open terminal
<br>
Type in npm run seed
<br>
Give it a few seconds for it to load data into MongoDB. 
<br>
Right now it loads 10 words into MongoDB. If you want more words, go into the seed file and change the number.
